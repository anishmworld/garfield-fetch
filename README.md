# garfield-fetch
## The program has two parts:
1. Powershell script to fetch garfield comics between dates and stores them in the folder it is launched in; And
2. A batch file launcher which hides the entrails and allows to set dates
## There are two main ways to use this:
1. You can use 'garfield-int.bat', which has the `StartDate and `EndDate` defined within the file. Open the file in your favorite text editor and change the dates as you want before you run.
2. You can use 'garfield-ext.bat', which when run, will ask for the `StartDate` and `EndDate`. The date input format is **YYYY-MM-DD**. Thus 21st March, 2017 will be 2017-03-21.
The oldest Garfield comic is on 19th June, 1978. Any dates before that wont work.
